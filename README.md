The game has 5 rounds.
In each round the player has 3 attempts to guess the artist full name by the Album name and cover.
If he does not succeed, another album is shown, and in the third and last attempt a hint is added too.

The scoring:
● If the user succeeds on the 1st attempt, he gets 5 points.
● If the user succeeds on the 2nd attempt, he gets 3 points.
● If the user succeeds on the 3rd attempt, he gets 1 point.

• When the user guesses the correct answer or failed on all three attempts, the
round is over.
• When all 5 rounds complete, the score is shown to the user.
